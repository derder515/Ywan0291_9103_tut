## Imaging Technique Inspiration
### Movement of Light and Shadow

I found inspiration for my final project from the movie "Loving Vincent" and star trail photography. Both works contain the trajectory of light and shadow movement. I think animating the light and shadow of artwork can make the artwork more dynamic while better complementing the background music. For example, the speed of the light and shadow flow could be determined by the tempo of the music.
